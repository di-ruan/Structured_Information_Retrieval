| Description      | The Miami Heat are an American professional basketball team based in Miami,   |
|                  | Florida. The team is a member of the Southeast Division in the Eastern        |
|                  | Conference of the National Basketball Association. They play their home games |
|                  | at the American Airlines Arena in Downtown Miami. The team owner is Micky     |
|                  | Arison, who also owns cruise-ship giant Carnival Corporation. The team        |
|                  | president and de facto general manager is Pat Riley, and the head coach is    |
|                  | Erik Spoelstra. The mascot of the team is Burnie, an anthropomorphic          |
|                  | fireball. Formed in 1988 as one of the NBA's four expansion franchises, the   |
|                  | Heat have won three league championships, five conference titles and 11       |
|                  | division titles. From February 3 to March 27, 2013, the Heat won 27 games in  |
|                  | a row, the second-longest streak in NBA history. In 2013, Forbes valued the   |
|                  | Heat at $625 million, sixth-most-valuable among NBA franchises. The Heat are  |
|                  | not related to the Miami Floridians, an ABA team in the early 1970s, although |
|                  | the Heat have occasionally paid tribute to the older franchise by wearing a   |
|                  | replica version of the Floridians' uniforms for the NBA's "Hardwood Classics  |
|                  | Nights" during the 200506 and 201112 seasons.                                 |
