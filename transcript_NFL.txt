| Description      | The National Football League is a professional American football league that  |
|                  | constitutes one of the four major professional sports leagues in North        |
|                  | America. It is composed of 32 teams divided equally between the National      |
|                  | Football Conference and the American Football Conference. The highest         |
|                  | professional level of the sport in the world, the NFL runs a 17-week regular  |
|                  | season from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each   |
|                  | team playing sixteen games and having one bye week each season. Out of the    |
|                  | league's 32 teams, six from each conference compete in the NFL playoffs, a    |
|                  | single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between   |
|                  | the champions of the NFC and AFC. The champions of the Super Bowl are awarded |
|                  | the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Various other awards exist to recognize individual |
|                  | players and coaches. Most games are played on Sunday afternoons; some games   |
|                  | are also played on Mondays and Thursdays during the regular season. There are |
|                  | games on Saturdays during the first two playoff weekends. Sometimes, there    |
|                  | are also Saturday games during the last few weeks of the regular season.      |
