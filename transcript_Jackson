| Descriptions     | Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958  June 25, 2009) was an American       |
|                  | recording artist, dancer, singer-songwriter, musician, and philanthropist.    |
|                  | Referred to as the King of Pop, Jackson is recognized as the most successful  |
|                  | entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His contribution to music, |
|                  | dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a    |
|                  | global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The seventh child of  |
|                  | the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his |
|                  | brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, then the Jacksons in 1964, and began   |
|                  | his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure |
|                  | in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of "Beat    |
|                  | It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller", were credited with transforming the       |
|                  | medium into an art form and a promotional tool, and the popularity of these   |
|                  | videos helped to bring the relatively new television channel MTV to fame And  |
