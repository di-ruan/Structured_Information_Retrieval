| Description      | The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a        |
|                  | professional basketball team based in New York City, New York. The Knicks are |
|                  | part of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National       |
|                  | Basketball Association. The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one   |
|                  | of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America, which       |
|                  | became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League in     |
|                  | 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden, above Pennsylvania Station in  |
|                  | the borough of Manhattan, and along with the Boston Celtics is one of only    |
|                  | two NBA teams still located in its original city. The Knicks were successful  |
|                  | during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the       |
|                  | franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made |
|                  | three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing     |
|                  | efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter. |
|                  | It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became head coach that the   |
|                  | Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided    |
|                  | the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973.                       |
